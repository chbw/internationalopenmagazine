I spent the last days of the year 2015 in Hamburg, Germany, together with 12.000 [hackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(computer_security) gathered at the [32c3](https://events.ccc.de/category/32c3/), the 32th yearly [Chaos Communication Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress), organized each year by Germany's famous [Chaos Computer Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Computer_Club). This is my report:

# arrival

I arrive very early in the morning at Hamburg with the night-train from Vienna. Hamburg is cold and dark, i need a whole day to orient myself. The [Congress Center Hamburg](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_Center_Hamburg), were the 32c3 takes place,  is a huge! And dark: Because hackers seem to shun irritating daylight, the whole congress centers is day and night illumated by subdued lights, the faint glowing of laptop screens and the blinking colours of countless [LED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode)s.

Unlike the free-for-everyone yearly [FOSDEM conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSDEM) in Bruxelles, the yearly Chaos Computer Congress (CCC) as well as the Chaos summer camp (every 4 years) does cost an entry fee. With 90,- Euro for the cheapest 4-day ticket, the fee is not expensive at all. The whole event is made possible because houndreds of "[Chaos Angels](https://events.ccc.de/tag/angels/)":  unpaid volunteer helpers, working enormous amounts of man-hours to make the event possible.

Nearly every possible work is done by volunteers: the people guarding the entrance, the hosts and video crews for each talk, the ultra-efficent cloakroom crew or the amazing tech wizards who maintained flawless wireless internet connection for all congress visitors: The Chaos Communication Congress operates on a shoestring budget and is only made possible by the effort and high work ethos of the volunteer chaos angels.  Several of them come days before the start of the event to help buildung up the infrastructure for the congress.

At my first day at 32c3, i carry a small netbook with me and spend some time trying to finalize my Linux install. An unneccessary task, because i end up using only my smartphone for in-congress-internet and i let the netbook stay in the hotel for the rest of the congress. Anyway, it's cool to have reliable, working wireless internet that is fast enough to do some real work. 

## opening keynote

Around noon of the first day the congress officially starts with the opening keynote. The biggest hall of the congress center can seat 3.000 people and is fully packed. After some video animation and official greetings,  keynote speaker [Fatuma Afrah](https://www.ccc.de/en/updates/2015/fatuma) talks about the congress topic, "gated communities". Fatuma Afrah's slightly nervous speech is greeted by the audience with warm applause. Personally, i find her background story more interesting than her actual speech: born in Somalia, her mother immigrated with her to Kenia as her father died. From there she managed to flee to Germany and currently works in refugee camps and as a motivation speaker. 

While i expect the speech to be about my classical imagination of gated communities, -fenced and guarded apartment areas for the rich in poor countries-, her speech is more about restriction of travel and and restrictrion of movement for refugees. I do not remember Fatuma Afrah actually useing the word "prison"  but she mades it clear that the differences between refugee camps and prisons are few. She also speaks of her work as volunteer translator in refugee camps and how *not having a voice* (command of the official language) makes a person *voiceless*, unheard and rightless.

The keynote itself is a political statement: The Chaos computer club takes part of the political opinion-building in Germany / Europe and seeks to get broader recognition outside the tech-bubble.

## communication

True to the word "communication" in "Chaos Communication Congress", the 32c3 operates it's own phone network in addition to providing free and reliable wireless internet access for all congress visitors. Friends advise me to only use cheap phones with the sim-cards sold at the conference "because you will be hacked". I used my smart-phone for communication via Twitter. Despite constant tweeting, i only manage to find my fellow [podcasting](http://biertaucher.at) visitor from Austria, [Stefan HASLINGER](https://twitter.com/informatom) on the next day by chance. We end up sheduling our meetings one day in advance. At the congress, there are lots of lots of people and meeting by chance is demanding more luck and planning than i'm used to from smaller conferences.

The 32c3 runs another communicatoin network that fascinates me endless: a hacked-togehter pneumatic post network! Yello flexible tube is criss-crossing  all floors of the congress center (ruining fire compartments?) and there exist even computer-operated "routers" or switches. Inside the tube, little transport capsules with [RFID chips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification) are transporting messages and gifts like JÃ¤germeister bottles. The transport capsules are made out of recycled plastic bottles sport stylish, colorful LED lights. The capsules are clearly visible and herable when whizzing through the tubes. I was told later by [Ajuvo](https://twitter.com/ajuvo) that one of the pneumatic network stations was operated by children. 

## children

I do not hold a children workshop on 32c3, but i get the impression that a chaos communication congress is a (hackers)family-friendly  place  visit. What i could see (and later am told by friends) is that the children are having a blast. The uppermost floor and some smaller congress rooms are mostly occupied by children doing workshops or various nerdy projects. [Anna Geiger](https://twitter.com/VermischtesAG) tells me later that some children were very shocked on the second day of the congress to realize that the event is already halfway over. There were designated children workshops and one specifice toy that attracted young and old alike: a real-time 3d illuminated sandbox.

I pass the "sandbox" several times without understanding why always a crowd of silent nerds are holding their hands in it and smiling in an strange, inward, religious way. As soon as i get a place myself at the sandbox i wish i have such a thing at home: It's a heap of sand on a plate. Above the plate is a (3d?) camera and a beamer. The camera measures the height of the sand and a connected computer calculates in real time a height-map, like in geographic maps: mountan tops are white, depressons are blue, hills are green. This image is projected with the beamer on the heap of sand in real-time. As i make little heaps and holes in the sand with my hand, the light changes and i can dig rivers and seas and create mountains and hills. It's so beautiful, like a mix of playing god and watching a screensaver.

## community and internationality

The chaos computer club organizing the event has it's own code of ethics and self-conception. One of this ethics is an urge not to be controlled by business or goverment organisations: "this is a bullshit-free zone: leave your business pitch at home" is a statement of the opening keynote. Unlike other tech congresses, recruiting and presenting tech-companies are not visible as such, even if many visitors get their ticket paid by their employer. 

The other self-conception i hear several time is "Endlich unter normalen Leuten" (=finally among normal people), followed by "this is holyday!". As typical nerds are spending way too much time behind a computer and hacking things that most of non-tech people find hard to understand (and value), the congress is seen as a much-deserved holiday from the "normal" world. A 4-day alternative reality not unlike the burning man festival. At the congress, rituals and norms dictated by an opressive majority who can't even code are downgraded into the "optional" range, while tech/hacking skills -"what you do"- rules. It's a black/white world (why colorful clothes? why sunlight?) were social skills, good looks, being popular, well connected and possessing approved degrees count for nothing, but being able to show (and share!) a technical "hack" counts everything. 

While most of the visitors are form Germany or german-speaking countries, the congress has a good international reputation and attracts quite a large group of international visitors. Nearly all talks are in English, and for the few talks in german language instant-translation is aviable via internet.

For a tech conference, the percentage of female visitors is pleasantly high (15%?) but it's still a "male withe nerd" gathering mostly.

The conference orginastors are hard at work to make the congress a pleast experience for not-hardcore hackers and new visitors. "Chaos PatInnen" provide guided tours and help for newcomers, and there is always a "chaos angle" nearby to answer questions or just to say "good morning" to new arrivals.

## talks and workshops

During the day (11:00 a.m. until midnight) 4 halls hold talks in parallel, in addition to many workshops (in smaller rooms) and more or less spontan organized gatherings. The lower floors are full of tables providing electricity and subdued light so that hackers can do what they love to do most, hacking. Various blinking, beeping and stunning hardware projects emerge from the tables over the days, and special interest groups gather together at community tables. I'm happy to find some people i know at the table of my [local hackerspace](https://metalab.at/).

Some talks and -most important- most partys start after midnight. The congress itself does not close, hackers who wish to do so can stay awake all the night and hack away or enjoy the "dance floor": a big hall were smoking is allowed, the music never stops and several cars and busses act as party-in-a-party zone.

"Please don't forget to sleep 6 hours, eat twice and take a shower once every 24 hours" is a constantly repeated slogan at the congress. 


## talks i remember

As some visitors, especially voluteers working as "chaos angles" tell me: "I'm here to meet people. I can watch the talks at home". As a congress newby, i constantly check the [talks shedule](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/Fahrplan/schedule.html) ("Fahrplan") and move around the congress to get a good seat at popular talks. 

I hugly enjoy the speech of Austrian law student Max Schrems (Europe vs. Facebook)  in the main hall. He has the rare talent to explain complex juristical terms and situations in an easy-to-understand way. He tells about his experience when first talking with Silicon Valley people about European privacy laws while visiting California: "Fuck European laws". He also seeks to build an organisation where law experts and tech experts can meet and exchange knowledge.

I also spend very much time in the lighting talks hall, where a mercyless crowd loudly shouts out a countdown as soon as a speaker comes to the end of his 5-minute time slot. The countdown is aided by a traffic-light - like device indicating the remaining seconds of each lightning talks. As always on tech conferences, i love lightning talks for the wide variety of speakers, topics and persenting performances. It's not easy to explain a topic in 5 minutes, but it's fun to watch.

Generally i seek out the political talks over the pure tech talks. The difference is fleeting however as nearly every technical topic touches actual politics (mass surveillance etc.) and most political topics touch into tech sphere. I like the "building hacker spaces in favelas" talk because of the community - centered bottom-up vs. top-down approach.

About some talks i hear "second hand" by friends who talk to me about the talks.

## podcast and other interest groups

I do some interviews and make a daily podcast (in german language) with my co-podcaster Stefan Haslinger. I have much fun at a table acting as "comic assembly", were comic artist paint comic stripes and discuss their art.

In the middle floor of the congress is a room acting as "podcast - stage": nearly always some podcast is recorded in front of life audience, and it's a good place to meet other podcasters.

I enjoy the fact that every sub-sub-sub-interest group can without formalities claim a table and start networking: a theater group performs on the escalators, lockpicking and soldering workshops (with [Mitch Altman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Altman)!) take place, Linux distros as well as local hackerspaces raise their banners at tables, fans of hackable knitting machines as well as  countless software project groups use the opportunity to meet in real life... 


General impressions:

 * It's all a bit much for the first time. I need several days to orientate myself. 
 * The congress makes incredible tired.. all this walking around, meeting excited people and staying up late. Make sure you sleep well, ideally some days in advance.
 * It's impossible to be at every interesting talk or meeting at the same time. Use your time wisely; unlike people, talks can be watched offline. 
 * I will be back 2016!
