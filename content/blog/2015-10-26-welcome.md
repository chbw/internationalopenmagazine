Summary: <div style="float: left; padding:5px"><img src="/images/doppeltuxklein.jpeg" width="100" alt="logo"></div> The first official article. Many more articles will follow<div style="clear:both;"></div>

After wasting days learning, breaking, modifying and playing around with the [Pelican blog engine](http://blog.getpelican.com/) (it's powered by [Python](http://www.python.org)!) instead of actually writing content: the first official article with the nearly final official layout is ready. It's what you looking at the moment. There should be a "tags" section to your left, listing all tags of all articles. Sadly, the design-theme I'm currently using and in love with, [Pelican-twitchy](https://github.com/ingwinlu/pelican-twitchy) does not like to cooperate with an necessary plugin. As a quick fix, please use [this link](http://internationalopenmagazine.org/tag) to see all tags listed. 

Hopefully, I will soon find out how to display tags in the elegant menu bar at the left.

Please note that this is a *blog post* and not yet an article for the **International Open Magazine**. An article may start as a tweet or as a tiny blogpost and will eventually grow into a large magazine article. However, most blogposts will simply stay blogposts and wander down the timeline into oblivion.
