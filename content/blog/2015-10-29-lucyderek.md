  * Lucy (L): Why did you write the book?
  * Derek (D): The publishers, [John Wiley &amp; sons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_%26_Sons), came to me and said [that] they are looking for sombody who had a lot of experience teaching [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu) to write a book about *Scratch for kids* in the *[for dummies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Dummies)* series. And since i did'nt had a job at the time i said: "Sure, i can do that". And i really was hoping that i can teach some of my favorites tricks, and teaching Scratch more for design rather than just coding. So i was really happy to do that.
  * L: What is your favorite trick in Scratch?
  * D: My favorite trick is <strike>taking</strike> making [sprites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)) from vector graphics, starting with *really* simple shapes. And then gradually making the shapes more and more complex to be things like faces and arms and legs, zombie teeths and werewolf claws. And also being able to take simple shapes and combine them with multiple shapes to make really cool looking animation and game characters.
  * L: What is your favorite thing from Scratch?
  * D: I think my favorite thing is being able to quickly and then add just a little bit of code to bring it to life.
  * L: [pause] Did you had fun making it?
  * D: I had so much fun making the book... But the hardest part, -that i did'nt had so much fun with it-, was the animation section. Because sometimes it is hard to write abount an animation, you want to show how it works. So a lot of times i wished that i can have little videos that people could click on, more like an ebook on an kindle or an ipad. 
  * L: What do you find easier, learning from an book or from an video?
  * D: I like to go back and forth, so for some things i definitely find it easyier to learn from video, like making music or doing animation. But for doing video game stuff i found it helpful to read a little bit and follow the code rather than stopping and starting a video over and over and over again. 
  * L: Why did you [write] especially for kids? 
  * D: I think kids are actually more creative than adults so i was excited that if kids have a little bit of coding and a little bit of designing experience with Scratch they can make way cooler projects than adults, [Horst enter the room] like [Horst](http://spielend-programmieren.at). 
  * Horst: Derek, why don't you get a real job?
  * L: What is the best animation you have ever done?
  * D: Oh, that's the hardest question you have asked so far, what's the best animation you have ever done....Um, actually, probably some of the 3D animations that i did in the ninties. 3D character animation, like .. i did an animation called clockwork orange juice that i really liked. [It was] about this young kids who ate a lot of junk-food and so it made them really violent. The would need to eat healtier so that adjust to society. 
  * L: What is the easiest thing to do in Scratch?
  * D: I think the easiest thing to do is to create web comics. You can make web comics really quickly, you could even use the built-in sprites, and then just add a little bit of code to make the charakters talk. Or think. 
  * L: How many kids have you taught Scratch? 
  * D: Ahhh, i don't know... i introduced Scratch to over a thousand kids just last week in [South Africa](https://youtu.be/7-pmMrL6bso), so that means way more than onethousand kids. Probably, um... When i think about it this way: every teacher that i teached Scratch to could teach 20, 30 or 100 kids. And i introduced [Scratch to] a lot of teachers. So i think 150342. That's how many.
