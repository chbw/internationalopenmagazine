<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration">FDA</a></b>: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or USFDA) is a federal agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, one of the United States federal executive departments. The FDA is responsible for protecting and promoting public health through the regulation and supervision of food safety, tobacco products, dietary supplements, prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceutical drugs (medications), vaccines, biopharmaceuticals, blood transfusions, medical devices, electromagnetic radiation emitting devices (ERED), cosmetics, animal foods & feed and veterinary products.<br>
The FDA was empowered by the United States Congress to enforce the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which serves as the primary focus for the Agency; the FDA also enforces other laws, notably Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and associated regulations, many of which are not directly related to food or drugs. These include regulating lasers, cellular phones, condoms and control of disease on products ranging from certain household pets to sperm donation for assisted reproduction.<small><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration">read more of Wikipedia entry about FDA...</a></small>

L. 96-517, December 12, 1980) is United States legislation dealing with intellectual property arising from federal government-funded research. Sponsored by two senators, Birch Bayh of Indiana and Bob Dole of Kansas, the Act was adopted in 1980, is codified at 94 Stat. 3015, and in 35 U.S.C. § 200-212, and is implemented by 37 C.F.R. 401.<br>
The key change made by Bayh–Dole was in ownership of inventions made with federal funding. Before the Bayh–Dole Act, federal research funding contracts and grants obligated inventors (where ever they worked) to assign inventions they made using federal funding to the federal government. Bayh–Dole permits a university, small business, or non-profit institution to elect to pursue ownership of an invention in preference to the government. <small><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayh%E2%80%93Dole_Act">read more of the Wikipedia entry about Bay-Dole Act...</a></small><br>

Everyone wants to be a successful venture capitalist. That’s the
conclusion I draw from [written
protests](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/why-are-universities-fighting-open-education) lodged
with the U.S. Department of Education by several higher education groups
to a [sensible and arguably long overdue rule
change](http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-launches-campaign-encourage-schools-goopen-educational-resources) proposed
late last year by the Obama administration. The Obama administration’s
goal, which is conveyed in a document called a [Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking](http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=ED-2015-OS-0105-0001),
is to modernize federal contracting procedures for the digital age by
requiring the use of open licenses on new intellectual property produced
with U.S. Department of Education grants.

The grants, [an estimated $2.8 billion in
2015](http://atlas.newamerica.org/competitive-grants-entitlements-formula-funding),
are often used to produce and test the impact of cutting-edge learning
resources, including educational games and assessments. Barring a
federal retreat and, with any luck, the updated rule requiring public
access to these taxpayer-financed digital learning resources goes into
effect later this year, that is, unless the administration backtracks
and caves under pressure from groups such as the[Association of American
Universities and the Association of Public Land Grant
Colleges](http://cogr.edu/COGR/files/ccLibraryFiles/Filename/000000000264/DoEd_12-14-15_aau_aplu_autm_cogr.pdf).

The new requirement for open licenses as the default would allow anyone
to freely use and improve digital learning resources if they were
financed by taxpayers. The objections raised by university
administrators and technology licencing managers are easy to understand:
there’s an enormous amount of money at stake. Universities, and
oftentimes the well-situated individuals who run them, are positioned to
rake in huge sums if they can stop the Department of Education’s
proposed new rule. What’s more, the chance to join the ranks of Silicon
Valley’s tech elite beckons. Who wouldn’t want to be the next [John
Hennessy](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117226912853917727) ?


The trick is this next round of big money payouts can only happen if
the college administrators can stop the public from owning what the
public paid for. In practical terms, what the university administrators
seek is an extension of the Bayh-Dole Act, a Reagan-era law that
privatized the fruits of taxpayer-financed research. Bayh-Dole was one
of the first major examples of the way right wing dogma was enshrined
into federal law during the ascendancy of conservative economics
post-Carter. The bipartisan law granted universities patent rights to
federally-funded inventions created on their campuses. With their latest
filings, the colleges now seek to extend their claims of ownership to
works financed by the public past those that can patented, such as new
inventions, to those that can only be copyrighted, such as digital
books, tests, and other online learning resources.

## Big Pharma is the Model

Big Pharma is a good example of how the relationship between
federally-funded research on campus and commercial markets now works (or
doesn’t). Gene-splicing technology, for example, was invented by Herbert
Boyer and Stanley Cohen in 1977. Before they expired in 1997, the
patents granted to their universities under Bayh-Dole had generated more
than \$200 million in royalty payments for the University of California
at San Francisco and Stanford, where the two scientists worked. Experts
universally agree gene splicing technology gave rise to the modern
biotech industry.

What is less well-known is that progress in practical applications of
genetic medicine dramatically accelerated after, not before, the
university patents expired. According to the FDA, [41 new molecular
entities and biotech drugs were approved in the U.S. during
2014](https://www.plunkettresearch.com/trends-analysis/biotechnology-drugs-pharmaceuticals-business-market/),
nearly [twice the average annual rate during the
1980’s](http://www.raps.org/Regulatory-Focus/News/2014/10/03/20488/How-Many-Drugs-has-FDA-Approved-in-its-Entire-History-New-Paper-Explains/),
when the gene splicing technology was still locked down. One reason: the
recent discovery that accurate genetic information, which is now more
readily available at lower costs, [doubles the success rate of new
investigational
drugs](http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-07-genetic-association-drug-significantly-boost.html).

The issue of whether the Big Pharma model should be extended past
patents to also include copyrights has gained traction recently as more
and more education moves online, a transition that has many rent-and
royalty seeking university technology managers and investors sensing a
potentially lucrative new opportunity. They hope, for example, to claim
ownership and cash in big time when the federal government provides a
grant to produce new online educational games that move obvious ideas,
such as a math quiz or a problem set suited for students with dyslexia
or autism, from pen and paper into a digital format.

## But what if gene splicing technology had been available for free use by every interested scientist when it was first invented, nearly 40 years ago?

Before universities are permitted to expand the financial incentives
they enjoy to also claim ownership of copyrightable works produced at
their schools that are paid for by taxpayers they should first be
required to accurately report the opportunity costs associated with the
last wave of federal research privatization. What if Bayh-Dole had never
been enacted and gene splicing technology had been available for free
use by every scientist and researcher when it was first invented, nearly
40 years ago? What if the federal government had mounted an aggressive
effort at that time — four decades ago — to develop and train research
teams to use free, open gene splicing technology to improve public
health? Are there better, faster models of drug discovery and
development that don’t involve giving an exclusive patent to the
university where the publicly-funded research happened to take place?
And finally, what is the name of your loved one who might still be alive
today if open science had come before private profits?

Even if the present Big Pharma-University research model really is the
very best way imaginable to most rapidly develop important new drugs and
bring them to market at affordable prices, which remains very much an
open question, there is no good reason to extend the same Reagan-era
privatization scheme to federally funded educational resources. There
are already ample venture capital funds available — \$48 billion in
2014 — to support proprietary ed tech ventures. Put simply, if
university administrators want to become venture capitalists in the
world of educational resources that is perfectly fine. But they should
use their own money, not the public dime.

Before computers, there was no question that when the government used
tax dollars to build a new brick and mortar school, the public owned
that school. No one would have ever dared propose that the contractor
who received public funds to build a school should also get the keys to
the school along with the right to extract royalty payments from all
those who entered. The U.S. Department of Education is merely trying to
make sure the same rules apply today when federal funds are used to
create what are essentially digital schools. The outcome will determine
whether Department of Education grants create public educational
resources that everyone everywhere can immediately use and build on, or
whether the fruits of those investments will be bottled up for decades
by academic institutions and administrators hoping to charge rent on new
digital educational products, tools and resources the public already
paid for.
